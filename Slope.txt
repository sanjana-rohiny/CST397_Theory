In the equation y = mx + c, "m" represents the slope of the line. The slope is a measure of how steep a line is and tells you how much y (the dependent variable) changes for a given change in x (the independent variable).

Mathematically, the slope "m" is calculated as the ratio of the change in the y-coordinates (vertical change) to the change in the x-coordinates (horizontal change) between two points on the line. It can be expressed as:

m = (change in y) / (change in x)

In simple terms, the slope represents the rate at which the dependent variable (y) changes with respect to the independent variable (x). If the slope is positive, it means that as x increases, y also increases, leading to an upward-sloping line. If the slope is negative, it means that as x increases, y decreases, resulting in a downward-sloping line. If the slope is zero, it indicates a horizontal line where y does not change with changes in x.
